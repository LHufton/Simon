The first thing I will do is create a board based off of a grid on html/css. 
I will assign a class and id to each div for styling purposes. 
The goal is to have each div flash the colour as it relates to the styling for that button. 
I will declare create buttons for on/off and reset. 
I will declare my global variables for the computer and player moves. 
I will create an event listener for the click function for each of the coloured buttons that corresponds to player choice.
I will create a seperate event listener for the reset button.
 I will use an initiate function for the on/off button. 
I will use the box in the middle (currently labeled Simon) as a message box to display "game over" and high score. 
I will need to use an array with indexes for each div element. 
I will call the array using math.random or something similar to represent the pattern chosen by the computer. 
I will need to match the pattern provided by the computer to the user using a for loop? To check if the input is true or false. 
If the input is true then the game will continue and the computer will keep picking random patterns until the players ultimately fails. 
Once the player does fail, the text box will output their score. 
I will find a means to assign a sound to each div as well as the colour. I want a flash of light and the corresponding sound.
