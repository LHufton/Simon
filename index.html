<h2> Introduction to Simon </h2>
<p>
Simon is an electronic game based on the popular children's game "Simon Says" where one person has to copy the movements of another person. This version of Simon pits the player against the computer. The computer will play a sequence of colours and it's up to you to match them. The more you match, the longer the game goes.
